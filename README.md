Just a webpage and python script to control Squeezelite players, Mopidy, and Internet Radio stations with a link to monitor your RPI.  you'll need to alter the html to point to your LMS server for Squeezelite players, and the local raspberry pi hostname if you want to mopidize this.  Your on your own for mopidy configuration.
