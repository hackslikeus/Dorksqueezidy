# Dorksqueezidy
Dorkbox with added functionality to control multiple squeezelite players or monitor your raspberry pi.  You'll need to alter the html to point to your LMS server for Squeezelite players, and the local raspberry pi hostname for RPIMonitor.  You'll also have to install Squeezelite and RPI Monitor separately.

Instructions : Download python file, index.html, and moodies.csv files. Create a folder on the server pi, ie. "dorksqueezidy", with a subdirectory for templates, (a flask thing) where the index.html bootstrap file should reside. The csv file will reside in the same folder as the python file. Note there is a reference or two in the python file to the html page, so rename at your risk, but not a big deal.  

Must have prerequisites include  MPD, MPC, Pip3, python3, Flask, and Tornado.  Optionals are RPI Monitor and Squeezelite with the Material skin. Should you choose Dietpi as your o/s, most of these packages can be found using dietpi-software.  MPC, flask, material skin and tornado would have to be manually insalled.  If you're a Squeezelite and Logitech Media Server - you'll need a running LMS Server.  This will enable multiple squeezelite players for a multi player setup.  (think whole house audio).  Just note the IP address of your LMS server and replace the index ip address in the html file with your servers address. See screenshot below.  
Once you have all the programs loaded and the files in place, simply run the python program from the command line. A one line indicator on the command line will alert you when it is OK to navigate to the web page. Navigate to the serving Pi's ip address at port 8080( for example "10.0.0.112:8080") using a web browser. Hit a play button and that should be it. Check your mpd.conf or soundcard settings prior or if no audio eminates from your speakers.
